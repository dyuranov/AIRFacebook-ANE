AIRFacebook | Facebook extension for Adobe AIR (iOS & Android)
==============================================================

AIRFacebook offers a rich and cross-platform API to the latest Facebook SDK for iOS and Android.

This is a demo application highlighting the core features of the extension. This repository also includes test version of the ANE (inside assets folder) that you are free to use during your development. In order to publish an application that uses this ANE you need to [obtain a license](https://gumroad.com/l/airFB).

The demo application is powered by [Starling Framework](https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework) and [Feathers UI](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers). Make sure to add these libraries to your project when building the application.
